    <h1 class="page-title">Facets for Filtering Down Search Results</h1>
    <p class="helptext">Information specialists like to talk about "facets" that are natural categories for filtering down a set of data.  With the ScienceMakers, a subset of the full set of
      HistoryMakers oral history interviews,
      the natural facets for categorization include the gender of the person being interviewed, his or her job family, and the birth year.
      Because most sets of data would have too many birth years listed, these are collapsed into birth decade.

    <p class="helptext visible-xs-block">
      For mobile (narrow width browsers), click the "FILTERS"" button in the upper right to bring up a filtering interface.
      The facet groups are listed under a "Refine Results" section at the bottom of the page.
      Tap/click the facet group title to open up a facet of interest.  You will see a count of the number of results within that facet.
      Facets give you a means of immediately seeing the distribution of results across their categorization, e.g., male and female.
      You can click a facet to then drill down to just those results having that facet, e.g., just the women.
      When ready to see the results again, of which you have a count already from this facet interface, click "APPLY FILTERS" at the bottom of the page.

      For widescreen browsers, look at the filtering interface in a "FILTER RESULTS" pane along the left edge of the page.
      The facet groups are listed there.
      Click/tap the facet group title to open up a facet of interest.  You will see a count of the number of results within that facet.
      Facets give you a means of immediately seeing the distribution of results across their categorization, e.g., male and female.
      You can click a facet to then drill down to just those results having that facet, e.g., just the women.
      You immediately see the results of the subset in the right portion of the page.

    <p class="helptext">This description says "results" because the result set could be biographies, i.e., the men and women in the archive.
      Or, the result set could be stories, i.e., what these men and women speak about.  See <a routerLink="/help/search" routerLinkActive="active">How To Search</a> for more information.

    <h4 class="header-4">Other Notes about Facets</h4>
    <ul class="helptext">
        <li class="helptext">Some results may not belong to a facet, e.g., some people that were interviewed did not give a birth date.
          They and their stories will not be part of the "Decade of Birth" facet.</li>
        <li class="helptext">Some facets have a one-to-one mapping with results, e.g., each result is in at most one decade of birth.</li>
        <li class="helptext">Some facets may have a many-to-one mapping with results; a result may have multiple job families for example.</li>
        <li class="helptext">Facets may help with some queries more than others, e.g., a researcher may want to drill down into an education job type, or might
          just wish to watch the count on the job type facet change across different queries.
        </li>
        <li class="helptext">Filtering is also possible through some interfaces shown with advanced search options, e.g., to search only certain fields, or
          return only interviews conducted in a certain year range.  See <a routerLink="/help/search" routerLinkActive="active">How To Search</a> for more information.
